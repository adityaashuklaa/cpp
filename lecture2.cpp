/* Time Complexity 
Rate of which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.
TC is computed in BigO Notation O()
Always compute TC in the worst case scenario.

Space Complexity is the combination of Auxilary space + Input space. 
c = a+b; Here c is just storing the computed value, so it is auxilary.
