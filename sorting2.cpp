// Merge Sort
/*
    There are three sorting algos but all of them where taking 0(n*2) TC, that's why Merge sort is used as it is more optimised in terms of TC.
    Merge sort is based on Divide and Merge. 
    Suppose you have an array of 9 elements, you have to divide them into two parts, and there are two ways to do that either 5/4 or 4/5. Here i'm following 5/4 path, and have to make sure i need to follow this approach throughout the sorting.
